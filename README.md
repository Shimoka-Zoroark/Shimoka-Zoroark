- Hello! I'm Shimoka!
- I'm intrested in learning more about coding, and electronics in general
- I'm currently (trying) to learn more on console repairing
- Right now, I'm not collaborating on anything except for character designing, and only for animal characters
- You can reach me at shimokazoroark@gmail.com
- For anyone curios, I go by she/her pronouns
- If anyone is able to help me understand the inner-workings of a furby better, that would be amazing!
